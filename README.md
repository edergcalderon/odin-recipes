# odin-recipes

This project will teach me how to create a basic recipe website with a few recipes using only HTML. After completing this project, I will have learned enough about HTML to move on to the CSS section of The Odin Project. After completing the CSS section, I will come back to this project to make it look nicer than what HTML can provide.
