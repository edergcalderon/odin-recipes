        <p>
            Despite my daily 3-mile runs, all the morning donuts have finally caught up with me. So Jason and I made a pact to
            lighten up our diet before our Cabo trip in 6 weeks. But instead of eating bland, boring salads, I decided to make a
            fun, healthy quinoa dish that we would both really enjoy.
            
            And that’s exactly what this quinoa dish is. With a fun Mexican twist, this dish is chockfull of so many amazing
            flavors, from the tangy lime juice to the hint of spiciness from the chili powder and jalapeno. And not only is this
            healthy and nutritious but it’s also unbelievably easy to make. Simply throw everything into the skillet and that’s it.
            Even the quinoa is cooked right in the pan, really letting the flavors soak in.
